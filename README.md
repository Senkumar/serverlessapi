# serverlessapi
## Simple serveless nodejs API implementation for educational purposes

Following are the steps followed.

    > npm install -g serverless
    
    > serverless create -t aws-nodejs
    
I have modified and simplified the serverless.yml for what I wanted to experiment. A simple HTTP API endpoint only. Renamed hello to index.
    
    > serverless config credentials --provider aws --key <ACCESS_KEY_VALUE> --secret <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_VALUE>
    
    > serverless deploy
